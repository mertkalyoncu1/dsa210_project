YouTube Watching Pattern Analysis with Finals Weeks

Project Description

This project explores the relationship between my YouTube viewing patterns and my academic schedule, particularly during finals weeks. The analysis focuses on understanding how my YouTube watching habits fluctuate on a monthly and weekly basis, with an emphasis on high-stress periods like exam preparation. The hypothesis is that YouTube watching times vary significantly during finals weeks compared to regular periods, offering insights into procrastination or stress-relief behaviors.

By analyzing the YouTube viewing history dataset, this project aims to uncover patterns and trends in digital media consumption during critical academic periods.

Dataset Description

1. YouTube Viewing History

This dataset was exported via Google Takeout and contains:

Timestamp: Exact date and time of video views.

Video Titles: Descriptions of the content watched.

Video URLs: Links for further exploration.

Channels: Content creators associated with the videos.

Metadata: Additional information like watch settings and history status.

This dataset will provide the basis for analyzing viewing habits across different periods, with a focus on identifying patterns during finals weeks.

Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Exploring Viewing Patterns

Analyze YouTube activity on a monthly and weekly basis.

Determine the hours during which I am most active on YouTube.

Compare viewing habits during finals weeks versus regular weeks.

2. Uncovering Behavioral Insights

Identify potential correlations between viewing habits and academic stress periods.

Analyze changes in viewing trends during finals weeks.

3. Creating Visualizations

Generate visually compelling representations of viewing trends, such as heatmaps and time-series graphs, to make the insights intuitive and actionable.

4. Documenting Key Findings

Summarize the results of the analysis to draw meaningful conclusions.

Highlight any surprising or unexpected patterns in my watching history.

5. Laying the Foundation for Future Analysis

Suggest additional avenues for exploration, such as analyzing content genres or viewing durations to understand stress-coping mechanisms.

Planned Steps

To achieve the project goals, the following steps will be undertaken:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Convert timestamps from UTC to local time for accurate interpretation.

Extract key fields, such as date, time, and video details, into a structured format like CSV for easier manipulation.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze the frequency of viewing by hour and day.

Summarize total time spent watching videos during finals weeks compared to regular periods.

3. Visualization

Create heatmaps to visualize hourly activity patterns.

Use time-series graphs to illustrate changes in habits over time.

Compare viewing behavior during finals weeks versus regular weeks using bar charts.

4. Insights and Documentation

Identify significant patterns, such as spikes in activity during late-night hours in finals weeks.

Present findings in a clear, actionable format with accompanying visuals.

5. Future Work and Recommendations

Explore deeper insights by analyzing content genres or viewing durations.

Suggest behavioral adjustments to enhance productivity during finals weeks.

Tools and Libraries

The project will utilize the following tools and libraries:

Python: The primary programming language for data processing and analysis.

Pandas: For cleaning, filtering, and structuring the data.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: To create static and interactive visualizations.

NumPy: For mathematical computations where needed.

Google Takeout: To export and download YouTube activity data.

These tools ensure efficient data handling and insightful analysis.

Acknowledgments

I extend my gratitude to Google Takeout for providing access to my YouTube watch history data. This project is a testament to how personal data can offer valuable insights when analyzed thoughtfully.
